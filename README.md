## Overview

This project is a solution to a programming challenge presented by Jibo.

It implements Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-function-to-detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/

The algorithm operates in constant memory space and is very useful for finding poorly formed singly linked lists.

Because the nodes that represent the lists in the challenge are accessible in ways other than starting at the LISTHEAD, and then along next-pointers, other solutions may exist. For instance, it is possible to start at border-edges that point off of the board and walk backwards, as though it were a doubly-linked list, doing a depth first traversal, and find all valid starting nodes, and either coloring or storing them. While efficient in time, that is not constant in memory space as required.

For a thorough discussion of good and bad solutions to loop-finding in singly linked lists, see:

#### External libraries and resources

The sprite-sheet was generated with TexturePacker:

PIXI supports the sprite sheets generated with this tool.

Sound support comes from pixi-sound:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-sound

Sound resources come from MovieWavs:

## Prereqs

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). (v6.5 or later) This will also install `npm` as a global command.

## Installing

Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Building

| Command | Description
|---|---|
|`npm run build` | Build the project in debug mode. |
|`npm run watch` | Watches files and will build every time a file is changed. Use this for development |
|`npm run clean` | Deletes built JavaScript files. |

## Executing

Run the command `electron main.js` to run the project.

## The Challenge

Consider a checkerboard of unknown size. On each square is an arrow that randomly points either up, down,
left, or right. A checker is placed on a random square. Each turn the checker moves one square in the direction
of the arrow. Visualize an algorithm that determines if the checker moves off the edge of the board or ends up in a cycle.

  - Include UI controls to play, stop, and reset the game.
  - Include UI controls to change the size of the board and to shuffle the arrows.
  - Include audio to make things more interesting.
  - Add some style to make it look good.
  - Write the algorithm in constant memory space. The brute force solution is O(n) memory space.

This challenge is meant to show off code organization, quality, and cleanliness, design patterns, and the ability to learn new languages
and ecosystems. Have fun with it.

## Some important notes

This project is bootstrapped to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript. TypeScript is very much like C# or ActionScript. It is a superset of JavaScript. This means that all JavaScript is valid TypeScript. Feel free to code this in vanilla ES6 JavaScript, but having type information is very helpful especially coming from a C++/Java/C# background.

To take advantage of TypeScript's strong types and an IDE's helpful autocomplete, install the Atom Editor and install the `atom-typescript` package.

Globally install `typings`. To do this, run the command `npm install typings -g`. `typings` allows you to install type information
about external npm modules. For example, if you were to use the
external module `async`, you would `npm install async`, and the run `typings search async`. It will display the name and the source.
To install the typings (which will be put in the `typings` folder of this project) run `typings install dt~async --global`. Then the TypeScript compiler will know how to compile against the async module.

The entry point to the application is `index.html`, which in turn points immediately to `index.js`. The typescript files in `src`
are all transpiled and browserified into a single JavaScript file at the root of the project, which is `index.js`. Do not modify this file as it is auto generated. Also do not modify `main.js`, which is just a bootstrap to get electron running.

Use whatever libraries you want from the npm public repository. You can find them [here](https://www.npmjs.com/) and install them with `npm install cool-lib-i-found --save`.

Included is a minimal setup for [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js), a 2D scene graph library that's GPU accelerated. If you've ever programmed ActionScript, it should look *very* familiar. The documentation can be found [here](https://pixijs.github.io/docs/index.html). Please use Pixi.js for all visualizations, UI, and interactions.

To debug the application goto `View -> Toggle DevTools`. This will bring up the DevTools debugger. This is the standard DevTools that comes with Chrome.
